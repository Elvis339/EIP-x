In this contract example:

mapping(address => uint256) public approvedActionsByDelegate: This mapping keeps track of the number of approved actions performed by each delegate.

address public tokenContractAddress: This state variable holds the address of the ERC20 token contract. The contract constructor now takes this address as a parameter.

event TokensTransferred: This event is used to log token transfers, allowing external systems to listen for and track token movements.

Inside the performAction function, we transfer tokenAmountToTransfer tokens from the contract to the delegate (msg.sender) using the transfer function of the ERC20 token contract.
