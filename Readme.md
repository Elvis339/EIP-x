Motivation:

TL;DR: Light clients struggle to efficiently access and validate data on the mainnet due to challenges in obtaining concise witness proofs. Verkle trees help lightweight clients transition between blocks but can't prove new state accuracy. Stateless clients lack state data for actions beyond transitioning. The Portal Network doesn't fully address these issues. Our solution adds a stateless verifier LC on the Portal Network with a cache to store important state fragments. We distribute the latest state using zero-knowledge proofs and propose a chase mechanism for efficient data retrieval. This addresses challenges in accessing state data for tasks like gas estimation and enhances lightweight client efficiency.
Project Description:

Light clients struggle to efficiently access and validate data. Currently, light clients, which rely on simplified verification, face challenges in accessing and validating the mainnet state due to the absence of concise witness proofs. These clients need to confirm blocks without having access to the full state.
Verkle trees allow very lightweight clients to consume proofs from other networks to transition from the last block to the new block. However, they cannot prove the accuracy of the new state root. If a stateless client discards all its stored information, it can still confirm the accuracy of new state roots. By doing so, a stateless client can still send transactions but cannot calculate gas estimates, perform ETH calls, or read Ethereum's state since it no longer maintains any state data. The client is limited to actions that involve transitioning from one state to the next state root, without any specific state-related functions.
This is where the Portal Network comes into play. While it allows the reading of random state data, it doesn't fully mitigate the core issue. The underlying challenge persistsâ€”efficiently accessing state data remains crucial for various tasks, including gas estimation. Additionally, Verkle trees, despite their benefits, don't inherently solve problems like federated access to the state.
To bridge this gap, an innovative solution comes in the form of the Portal Network introducing a stateless verifier LC (Lightweight Client) with a partial state caching mechanism to enhance the efficiency of accessing specific segments of the state. It achieves this by storing frequently accessed or important state fragments in a cache, enabling clients to retrieve them more quickly than repeatedly traversing Verkle trees.

Our proposal of partial state caching complements our goals in these ways:

- Improved Retrieval for Stateless Clients:
  Stateless clients lack the ability to store the full state and rely on external means to access data. By using partial state caching, we offer an efficient method for these clients to access vital state fragments, reducing their reliance on complex Verkle tree processes.

- Less Data Transfer and Computation:
  Stateless clients struggle with data transfer and computation. Partial state caching lets them access pre-cached data, lessening the need for extensive data transfers and computational work, in line with the efficiency objectives of stateless clients.

-Decentralized, Trustless Verification:
  Stateless clients aim for trustless Ethereum network interaction. Through partial state caching, clients can independently verify cached state fragment validity using zk proofs, preserving trustlessness by eliminating dependence on a central source.

-Swift Data Retrieval:  Cached state fragments are readily available, bypassing the need to rebuild or navigate the Verkle tree for each request. This rapid access to cached data results in quicker retrieval times compared to direct tree fetching, especially for frequently needed data.

- Reduced Network Latency:
  Cached fragments can be fetched locally, reducing the reliance on multiple network interactions for Verkle tree traversal. This minimizes network delay and enhances responsiveness.

- Efficient Resource Use:
  Cached fragments reduce computational load during Verkle tree traversals, particularly for complex state structures. This optimizes computing resource utilization.

- Consistency and Validity:
  The partial state caching mechanism ensures consensus-validated data, preventing caching of compromised or invalid data. This boosts integrity and data retrieval reliability.

-Optimized State Access:
  Partial state caching can prioritize frequently accessed state fragments, catering to stateless clients' needs for specific data subsets. This speeds up necessary information access, elevating overall efficiency.

- Improved Security and Reliability:
  Stateless clients face security risks with third-party state data. Incorporating cryptographic proofs and cached state fragments empowers clients to autonomously verify data integrity, boosting security and reliability in Ethereum network interactions.


## Roadmap


Roadmap for MVP Development of Hybrid Witness Sharing and Stateless Account Abstraction Proposal:

Phase 1: Research and Planning

1. Conduct In-Depth Research: Perform a comprehensive study of existing stateless account abstraction models,
   hybrid witness sharing techniques, and their potential integration with Ethereum's current ERC-4337 architecture.
   Identify any modifications required to adapt the ERC-4337 flow for the proposed solution.

2. Define Use Cases: Identify and document specific use cases that will be showcased in the MVP to demonstrate
   the benefits of the proposal. Consider scenarios where witness sharing and stateless account abstraction can lead
   to improved efficiency, reduced gas consumption, and enhanced scalability.

3. MVP Scope and Features: Define the scope of the MVP, including the core features that will be implemented,
    such as state provider with zk-proof, witness sharing model, and the necessary modifications to the ERC-4337 architecture.

Phase 2: Development

1. Implement Witness Sharing Model: Develop the witness sharing model, leveraging cryptographic techniques like Merkle trees or zk-SNARKs.
   The model should efficiently share witness information among multiple transactions, optimizing gas consumption for transaction validation.

2. Stateless Account Provider with zk-Proof: Create a state provider that stores essential data required for transaction execution,
  adhering to the stateless account abstraction concept. Implement zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to ensure data integrity and security.

3. Implement Statelss Verifier as a light client

Phase 3: Integration and Testing

1.  Modify ERC-4337 Architecture: Make minor modifications to the ERC-4337 architecture to accommodate the proposed hybrid witness
   sharing and stateless account abstraction. Ensure compatibility with existing smart contracts and functionalities while integrating the new components.
3.  Integration with Bundler and Entry Point Smart Contract: Integrate the developed state provider and witness sharing model
   with the bundler and entry point smart contract of ERC-4337. Verify that all components work seamlessly together to
   facilitate transaction execution and witness sharing.

4. MVP Testing: Conduct extensive testing to ensure the MVP's functionality, security, and performance. Perform unit testing,
   integration testing, and simulate real-world scenarios to validate the proposal's benefits and use cases.


Continuous Improvement: Continuously refine and optimize the MVP based on community feedback and new research findings.
 Explore potential enhancements, security updates, and additional features that can be incorporated to further improve the proposal's efficiency and scalability.

By following this roadmap, the development team can create a functional MVP showcasing the benefits of the hybrid witness sharing and stateless account abstraction proposal without the dependency on Verkle trees or protocol-level changes. The MVP can serve as a powerful demonstration of the proposed solution's potential and open up new possibilities for the Ethereum community.


## Goal of the project

Success for the  Stateless Account Abstraction project would be achieved when the proposed solution is 
fully developed, implemented, and widely adopted within the Ethereum community. The end goal is to demonstrate a functional MVP 
that showcases the benefits of hybrid witness sharing and stateless account abstraction while providing tangible improvements to 
Ethereum's efficiency, scalability, and usability. All are accomplished without dependency to a statelessness roadmap or conduction 
of changes within the core.
