Stateless Account abstraction that scales Ethereum.

## Motivation

Ethereum's state grows rapidly, burdening consensus nodes with 35 GB state and 100 GB with proofs, increasing every six months. 
The increasing state size hampers scalability, imposing storage and processing burdens on nodes. Participants pay one-time costs perpetually,
raising economic concerns. Additionally, ERC-4337 wallets incur elevated gas costs (~42000 gas for basic operations) due to multiple storage read/write costs, business logic overhead, and log payments not required in EOAs. A stateless-based solution is essential to maintain  Ethereum's efficiency and long-term viability. Additionally, the light clients, which do not store the entire state but rely on simplified verification mechanisms, struggle to efficiently access and  validate the state data against the mainnet. The lack of a concise and constant-sized proof of the current state limits light clients' ability to interact with the blockchain seamlessly.
Therefore we Propose a stateless Account abstraction model which doesn't force any change in the current Ethereum core but can solve the above problems at the account level. The advantage of having succint zk proof of the state is that it is possible to broadcast it across the nodes. Currently, to validate a block, light clients must request the state piece by piece, and this results in many light clients frequently burdening the full node altogether.


## Project description

The challenge at hand is to enable stateless verification of blocks in the blockchain system. The goal is to allow clients to verify the
correctness of individual blocks without needing a full state. Instead, clients can rely on compact witness files generated by state-holding nodes, which contain the portion of the state accessed by the block along with proofs of correctness. This stateless verification offers several benefits, including supporting sharding setups and reducing reliance on validators. The state provider entity is at the core of stateless AA, providing a succinct and constant-sized proof of the current state. Light clients can effortlessly verify this proof against the mainnet, improving scalability, and reducing resource requirements for light clients. Users and applications can efficiently interact with the blockchain, relying on the security and integrity of zk-proofs to verify the state. This approach enables more participants to engage with the network without needing the computational resources and storage capacity required for full nodes.


## Specification

To sustain scalability, we propose Stateless Account Abstraction with Two new entities: 
## 1- State provider: 
this entity consists of Ethereum light clients  providing the latest  state, peer to peer network and  ZK circuit. 
We introduce a decentralized peer-to-peer network with a state provider entity, collaborating to validate and generate ZK-SNARKs proofs 
for state information.A lightweight client verifies proofs and validates state data from the state provider.

A- ZK-SNARKs for State Proof:
To provide a trustless and efficient proof of state, we employ ZK-SNARKs, a cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to generate 
a succinct proof of the validity of a statement without revealing any sensitive information. By using ZK-SNARKs, the state provider can
generate proofs of state integrity that can be verified by any participant in the peer-to-peer network, ensuring the trustworthiness of 
the provided state.

B- Peer-to-Peer Network:
The proposed solution requires a decentralized peer-to-peer network to distribute the state provider functionality. Peers in the network 
collaborate to validate and generate ZK-SNARKs proofs for the requested state information. This distributed approach ensures fault tolerance,and resilience, and enhances the scalability of the state provider.

C-Proof Generation and Validation:
When a stateless transaction enters the alternative mempool, it includes a reference to the required state information. The state provider 
peers collaborate to generate a ZK-SNARKs proof that verifies the validity and integrity of the specified state against the Mainnet. 
This proof is then shared with the requesting node, allowing it to verify the state without relying on direct interaction with the
Ethereum Mainnet.

## 2- Efficient Witness Verification through Specialized Contracts and Caching


This entity is dedicated to verifying each block in Ethereum's sharded system, leveraging zero-knowledge (zk) proofs for state verification. A novel approach, based on EIP-210, involves using a specialized contract to store block hashes directly in the state. This offers advantages such as eliminating the need for special encoding in the witness and enabling the inclusion of older block hashes beyond the past 256 blocks, enhancing system flexibility and historical context.

To optimize witness retrieval and reduce redundancy, a caching mechanism is proposed within the Light Client. This mechanism stores previously accessed witnesses, minimizing redundant witness requests, especially for transactions frequently accessing the same shard.

The specialized contract is designed with well-defined functionalities, data structures, and access controls. It efficiently stores and retrieves block hashes, ensuring access by stateless light clients and other components for cross-shard interactions. Events are emitted to notify stateless light clients of new block hashes, maintaining up-to-date records. Gas efficiency, concurrent access handling, and security considerations are also taken into account in the contract's design.

By implementing this approach, light clients can efficiently verify stateless blocks, and the sharded system gains improved witness efficiency and gas optimization. The specialized contract serves as a reliable registry, mapping block numbers to corresponding block hashes, and simplifies witness management and distribution. Overall, this proposal aims to enhance Ethereum's scalability and efficiency in a sharded environment.
